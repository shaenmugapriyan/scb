for user creatiion and deletion:

Solution 1: 

First went with AWS Transfer family  but since frugality was the priority and aws transfer family is expensive dropped this.

Solution 2:

Created codecommit repo, codebuild with the same vpc that ec2 is using. created a ansible script for sftp user management and ran it with codebuild.

Solution3.

Tried to do everything using terraform as it seems to be cost-efficient.
